## Movie Watch List Site

A simple site that will allow people to create and share movie watch lists. People will be able to:

* Create and manage lists of movies that they want to watch
* Share the lists with other people
* Leave reviews and ratings about movies they have watched
* Also, we shouldn't gather information that we don't need, but it would be nice if people could have a profile about themselves.

Along side movies, we want people to be able to look up actors and actresses and see what movies they have been in. This is a good way for people to find new movies that they might be interested in. When it comes to actors, people will be able to:

* Find actors that have been in movies that they have watched
* See movies that an actor has been in
* Leave reviews of an actor

To run this website, we need to be able to manage the data in it. So we want to be able to do the following things:

* Create and manage movie records
* Create and manage actor and actress records
* Write blog posts about interesting movies and actors
* Manage accounts, including creating new ones and banning people that are causing problems

To run project:
* run virtualenv - source venv/bin/activate
* python manage.py runserver
